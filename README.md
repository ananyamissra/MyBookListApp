# MyBookListApp
This is an application to make a list of books using basic HTML and with a good usage of JavaScript.

This project is an interactive web application that allows users to keep track of books they've read or want to read. Users can input book details such as title, author, and ISBN number, and the app displays the list of books along with options to remove them.

**Features:**
- **Bootstrap Styling:** The interface is styled using the "Yeti" theme from Bootstrap to provide a clean and responsive design.

- **Add Book Form:** Users can enter book details (title, author, and ISBN) in the provided form. Upon submission, the book is added to the list.

- **Book List Display:** The app displays a table showing the added books' titles, authors, and ISBN numbers. Each book entry also has a "Remove" button.

- **Local Storage:** The app utilizes local storage to persist the list of books even after refreshing or closing the page.

- **User Alerts:** User-friendly alerts are shown for successful actions (adding or removing books) as well as error cases (missing fields).

**How to Use:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the MyBookList app.
3. Use the form to input book details (title, author, and ISBN) and click "Add Book."
4. The added book will appear in the list below the form.
5. To remove a book, click the "Remove" button next to the respective book entry.
6. Books are saved using local storage, so they will be retained even after closing the app.
